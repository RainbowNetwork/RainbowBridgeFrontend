        <b>The Secret Bridge has been officially deprecated. What does this mean?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>1. The contracts have been disabled, and the bridge is offline.</li>
          <li>2. All funds are safe. Tokens that support migration can be redeemed at the new {' '}
            <a href="https://tunnel.scrt.network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scrt.tunnel</a>.
          </li>
          <ul>
            These tokens are:
            <br />
            Ethereum: USDT, USDC, ETH, DAI, WBTC
            <br />
            BSC: BNB
          </ul>
          <li>
            3. Tokens that are not supported in the new scrt.tunnel are available via a manual claim process. Any unclaimed
            funds are kept in cold storage and can be claimed at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. WSCRT migration to axlSCRT will be supported in the near future.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <b>Help, my tokens aren't in the list!</b>

            If you have assets that do not support migration, please reach out to the Secret Bridge team. We will assist
            in the manual claim process. Your funds will be kept in cold storage until you claim them. Contact us at bridge.claims@scrtlabs.com if you wish to migrate legacy tokens.
